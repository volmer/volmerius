  <h2 class="title is-2">About this guide</h2>

  <p>
    This is a project to define a sustainable architecture for software
    development in Ruby on Rails. It is a collection of ideas, lessons, and
    best practices that allows Rails apps to be easy to change and acommodate
    new features.
  </p>

  <p>
    In fast growing teams, Rails apps need to be maintained and extended while
    running flawlessly to best serve the business and its customers. Defining
    an architecture that allows sustaining constant modifications is a software
    design challenge faced by engineering teams everyday.
  </p>

  <p>
    From that challenge comes useful practices and patterns proven to help
    escalate software development for the long term. This guide is an initiative
    intended to formalize a few of these common practices, particularly around
    input validation, use case coordination, and data modelling/persistance.
  </p>

  <p>
    This guide is not the definitive architecture for Rails. It is simply a good
    starting point. The proposed layers are intended to be used as specified, or
    as inspiration to help developers design soluations for their own needs. The
    goal of this project is not to be perfect; rather, it recommends practices
    with thoughtful trade-offs that can pay for themselves in the long run.
  </p>

  <p>
    I hope the ideas documented in this Guide can help you and your team deliver
    great products built with Rails, in a sustainable, happy, and fun journey.
