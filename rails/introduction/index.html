<div class="content rails-page-content"><p>I still remember the joy I experienced after building my first Rails app. It was
2009, when I used Rails 2 to create a discussion board website. Everything was
simple, quick, and easy to understand. After unpleasant experiences with Java
and PHP for anything-web-related up to that point, I felt an incredible sense of
liberation, like I could achieve anything I wanted with just a few commands and
lines of Ruby. Needless to say, my first Rails app was a side-project maintained
by a single person with very little functionality. Under those circumstances,
everything was just perfect.</p>
<p>Soon after, I was doing Ruby on Rails as my full time job. At that time, I
started engaging with different teams of developers, designers, and product
managers to build fast-growing projects. Things still looked pretty good: green
field projects where we got an advantageous headstart with a couple of Rails
scaffolding and smart CRUD operations. As soon as an app would grow to a
significant size, however, something interesting started to happen: the teams
experienced an increasing drop in development speed, and the project backlogs
would get filled with “technical issues” and “refactoring” tickets. People felt
that the code needed to be rearranged in order to fix bugs and implement new
features.</p>
<p>After moving to Canada in 2014 I got an engineering position at Shopify. Shopify
was already famous for its huge Rails monolith that delivered incredible
performance at an unimaginable scale. Over my years at the company I had the
chance to work not only on Shopify’s core monolith but also create and
contribute to multiple other Rails apps. At Shopify, I noticed that the
phenomenon of growing Rails apps getting harder and harder to deal with was not
exclusive to my previous workplaces. My focus then turned towards how to better
organize these codebases so they could be easy to change regardless of the
growing number of developers as well as lines of code required to keep them
competitive and innovative.</p>
<p>Each Rails app I worked on had unique challenges, often related to its very
nature, scale, and purpose. But with experience I started to notice that some
challenges were quite common to all of them, especially in regards to code
organization. For some reason, controllers and models always ended up overly
large, business logic was hard to understand (and therefore hard to change), CI
times slowed everybody down, and test suites were impossible to be executed
locally in their entirety.</p>
<p>In these recurring situations, I really missed that joy I felt when I did my
first Rails app. “What did go wrong?” was in the back of my mind always. I
wanted to be able to experience the developer happiness I had from the very
beginning of my <code>bundle exec rails new</code>, all the way to the point the app is up,
running, and winning. As a developer lead, it became clear to me that, in order
to remain successful at building great products, a team must find solutions to
keep their codebases easy to change despite its size and complexity.</p>
<p>I knew that neither the problem nor the answers could lie within Rails
itself. After all, I loved Rails for the things I used it for: great routing,
convention over configuration, simple and easy to use APIs for the web, mailers,
and jobs, a great persistence layer with Active Record, and more. It was my own
responsibility to design my application logic responsibly, using the
object-oriented powers of Ruby.</p>
<p>For that purpose, I started cataloguing the code smells I found recurrently in
apps I worked on, and by borrowing ideas from different frameworks, teams,
mentors, or by simple stubborn trial and error, I adapted patterns that helped
me and my teams be more productive in our Rails apps. These patterns were not
new; many of them in fact were decades-old and widely used in the enterprise
world that I left behind once I started doing Ruby on Rails. Life is full of
irony after all. After using and reusing these patterns, in part or in full, in
multiple apps and teams, I had the chance to refine them to a point that some of
them became very good defaults for my subsequent Rails apps.</p>
<p>People eventually took notice of this design, and started asking me if I had
documented it somewhere. Reluctantly, I had to admit that I did not write about
them anywhere at all. Everything was either in my head or in the Ruby code I had
written in my past apps. Not only that made it difficult to share those ideas,
but also meant that I had to reinvent the wheel whenever I created a new Rails
app. I literally had to do some code archeology to remember the smells,
patterns, and APIs, so I could implement them all over again.</p>
<p>And that is what motivated me to start this guide. This project intends to
compile the most basic patterns I had used with my teams to build a sustainable
architecture in Rails. Now I have the chance to give them names, to think about
proper, reusable APIs, as well as to write proper documentation so future me and
anyone else can understand the reasonings behind them.</p>
<p>This project also has given me the opportunity to write some reusable code as a
Ruby gem, to make it easier to adopt these practices in new Rails apps. This is
something I haven’t done previously; in my apps, I wrote and rewrote all these
patterns from scratch. That being said, this guide focuses on the patterns
themselves; anyone can adopt them in full or in part without having to install
anything. In the end, these practices are just classic object-oriented design,
and not an intricate new framework.</p>
<p>It is important to note that this work is, first and foremost, an experiment. As
I mentioned before, I had used the patterns shipped in this guide in different
scales and shapes, and they had helped me create a better maintainable code;
this project as a formalized and integrated architecture, however, is at its
very infancy. There are many questions without answers, and edge cases to be
dealt with. The eason I am sharing this work early on is because I value
transparency and I believe in the power of collaboration. I hope the contents of
this experiment will spark constructive discussions that can create a virtuous
feedback loop that everybody can benefit from.</p>
<h2>Is this guide for me?</h2>
<p>This guide is best suited for experienced Rails developers. If you are just
getting started with Rails, I recommend starting with the official
<a href="https://guides.rubyonrails.org">Rails Guides</a> instead and not diverging too
much from the standard Rails way until you are comfortable with those tools.</p>
<p>Like anything else in the universe, applying this guide involves a trade-off. It
increases indirection in order to give your app a more robust foundation for
further growth. This added indirection can only pay off once your app reaches a
certain level of complexity. Smaller apps might be actually harder to deal with
if this extra design work is not justified. This is made clear in the <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/DesignStaminaHypothesis.html">Design
Stamina Hypothesis</a>:</p>

<p>The question that remains is at what point in time the design activities should
start; in other words, how can we identify that “design payoff line” when
introducing an architecture such as the one proposed in this guide is justified.
This is a tricky question, but in my experience, teams err much more often on
the side of waiting too long than designing too early. A great way to develop a
good foresight is to be in close contact with the businesses goals of the
organization you work on. By knowing where the company is heading and what the
growth plans are, you can make a more assertive decision if going with extra
layers and indirection makes sense to your reality or not.</p>
<p>It is important to warn you that this guide is born from the opinion that having
smaller objects with single responsibilities that collaborate with each other is
better than having large objects that do many things. The goal of this project
is not to teach object-oriented design, however. If you are new to this
approach, it might be a good idea to start with some educational content in
software design. If you are experienced with object-oriented design but disagree
with this stance, then this guide might not make much sense to you.</p>
<p>Finally, this guide might only make sense for those who felt <em>the pain</em>. If,
like me, you’ve been at that place of questioning your own design choices when
building your app, or you feel trapped in procedural code that is hard to
change. You might benefit from this architecture, or might be inspired by it to
create your own solutions.</p>
<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p>This project would not have been possible without the teachings and inspiration
from other works. Firstly, Sandi Metz’s <a href="https://www.poodr.com/">Practical Object-Oriented Design in
Ruby</a>, as well as her talks, were invaluable for me
being able to better rationalize around writing code that is easy to change. The
concepts and ideas described in this guide also got a lot of inspiration from
great projects such as <a href="https://hanamirb.org/">Hanami</a>, <a href="https://github.com/trailblazer/trailblazer">Trailblazer</a>, and <a href="https://dry-rb.org/">dry.rb</a>. I highly
recommend checking these projects out.</p>
<p>Many thanks to my teammates across companies that experimented with these
patterns with me through the years. Their feedback in meetings, calls, and pull
requests were indispensable for the maturity of these ideas.  I am grateful also
to the dozens of developers who read, shared, and commented on this content with
constructive criticism. Your input helped immensely to filter the nonsense out
and polish the good stuff.</p>
