<div class="content rails-page-content"><p>A standard Rails app responds to incoming requests by exchanging messages
through a stack of framework layers. From the Routes level, a request is
delegated to a Controller action that processes the request and returns an HTTP
response. By default the stack can be simplified as the diagram below.</p>
<p><img src="/images/rails/diagram_1.jpg" alt="Diagram 1"></p>
<p>Auxiliary frameworks such as Active Job, Action Mailer, and Views can be called
by controller actions as needed.</p>
<p>This stack alone is a perfect fit for most features, as long as their business
logic is simple and lightweight. In the reality of production apps with a big
surface area, this is hardly the case. Processing requests and crafting
responses involves many steps, with preconditions to be checked, conditional
statements, validations, and multiple combinations of different responses.</p>
<p>Since the stack above does not bring answers to how the business logic should be
structured, apps are left with the homework of properly organizing the
orchestration of steps required to process use cases. Software design is a
costly exercise, however, and very often overlooked or ignored; so business
logic is simply left to creep around the same initial Rails stack in a
procedural fashion. This lack of design can be spotted by identifying some
common signs of problems with software design, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_smell">code
smells</a>.</p>
<p>A code smell is not necessarily an issue or bug: it is simply a surface
indication that there <em>could</em> be an underlying problem with how the code is
designed. As pointed out by <a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CodeSmell.html">Martin
Fowler</a>, &quot;smells aren't
inherently bad on their own - they are often an indicator of a problem rather
than the problem themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>The lack of proper design for organizing business logic produces some very
common smells in Rails apps. The list below compiles a few recurrent ones.</p>
<h2>Illegible Routes</h2>
<p>Routes map request patterns to controller actions. It employs a specific DSL
that is optimized for resourceful routes: mappings that follow the seven
standard REST operations for a given controller.</p>
<p>In growing production apps, the overload of features and changes takes a toll in
the routes organization, leading to an increasing number of non-resourceful
routes to creep in, constraints to create exceptional mappings for edge cases,
repetition, and so much more. The result is a routes file that is impossible to
be deciphered.</p>
<h2>Convoluted Controller Callbacks (Before Actions)</h2>
<p>Before Actions, the popular callbacks for controller actions, are handy tools
for checking and early responding to some common preconditions such as
throttling and authentication.</p>
<p>After multiple iterations, bug fixes, and features added on top of one another,
Before Actions are abused in order to handle a myriad of convoluted
preconditions. It is not uncommon to see controller actions that, in order to be
executed, need to pass many Before Actions.</p>
<p>These callbacks might also be conditional, or apply to just a subset of actions
in a given controller, which further impedes understanding of what is actually
happening in a controller. Not to mention when controllers inherit Before
Actions from their ancestors.</p>
<h2>Large Actions</h2>
<p>The ultimate smell in Rails apps.</p>
<p>Incoming requests are handled by actions, the controller public methods. These
methods are called once for each request, and they are responsible for crafting
an appropriate HTTP response.</p>
<p>In theory, actions would collaborate with other layers of the application so
they remain lightweight. The reality of most apps is very different: actions are
long sequences of procedural code, with nested conditionals and coupling with
multiple constants.</p>
<p>The reason why actions are long and complex in many apps is because they
are just the most convenient place in the entire Rails stack to shelve quick
changes and fixes. Given that controller methods are the predictable paths of
the code to be executed for a request, developers often can ignore all the rest
and inject the code they want straight in the controller action and the job is
done.</p>
<p>Obviously this is not a good design nor a healthy practice long term. As actions
accumulate complex and long procedural code they become very difficult to
understand, its behaviour unpredictable, leading to bugs and an increasingly
slower development process. Large actions also negatively affect testing: since
controller’s behaviours are asserted with integration tests, in order to assure
coverage a lot of integration test cases are written as system and browser tests
that are much slower than unit tests, ultimately leading to terribly slow CI
times.</p>
<h2>Private Methods in Controllers</h2>
<p>This specific smell is a consequence of long actions. A common refactor employed
to address long methods such as actions is to break the code down into smaller
private methods. This refactor is a worrisome anti-pattern that replaces the
long method smell with a much worse-smelling collection of needless indirection.</p>
<p>It is interesting to find Rails apps in which controllers have a relatively
lightweight collection of actions that actually hides a long and complex private
interface. Masking out complex actions by using private methods doesn’t do any
good, and actually increases the overall size of controller classes.</p>
<p>A no-brainer fix for the private methods smell is to replace their calls in the
action code with their contents. At least long actions are honest about their
faults, exposing to the world their dire complexity.</p>
<h2>Single-Use Mixins</h2>
<p>Another attempt to hide the complexity of large actions is to break them down in
smaller single-use methods, but instead of marking them as private in the
controller, they are moved to a module that is included in the inheritance
chain. Sometimes referred to as Concerns, these mixins are simply adding
needless indirection without addressing the fact that the controller is doing
too much.</p>
<p>Similarly to private methods, these mixins should be removed and their code
incorporated back into the controller that includes them. Not as separate
private methods, but to have their body reinserted directly in the actions that
call them.</p>
<h2>Extensive Ruby Code in Views</h2>
<p>Views are templates where data is interpolated to generate the response body,
usually ERB files that output HTML. Because these files can accommodate any Ruby
code, they are often abused with nested conditionals, variable assignments, and
even direct database queries. This is due to the overflow of business logic
beyond controller actions and models: developers know their actions and models
are already too big, so extra code simply finds the path of least resistance in
view files. The problem extensive Ruby code in views cause is cluttering: files
that were supposed to be made of mostly markup and data interpolation become
long sequences of conditionals and procedure code.</p>
<h2>Coupling in View Helpers</h2>
<p>When additional presentation logic is required in view files helpers can be of
use. View helpers are functional mixins that processes the given arguments and
returns bits of output that are later interpolated in view templates. As of any
other layer in the Rails stack, however, they are also abused to accommodate
intrusive business logic beyond their initial responsibilities.</p>
<p>The most obvious symptom of unhealthy view helpers is when they are coupled to
other parts of the codebase, referencing constants from models, controllers, and
more. This is commonly seen when view helpers depend on instance variables from
controllers; ideally helpers should receive all the data they require via
arguments. This ensures that they are kept lightweight, idempotent, and easy to
test.</p>
<p>Another recurring consequence of this coupling is that it makes testing view
helpers quite painful. Often developers simply give up in giving helpers proper
test coverage due to how difficult it is to assert their behaviour.</p>
<h2>Active Record Callbacks</h2>
<p>Rails offers hooks to execute certain routines before, after, and around Active
Record operations. For example, checks and transformations before a record is
saved in the database, or emails and jobs can be performed after a successful
update.</p>
<p>Since these callback methods are called implicitly by the framework, they can
become inadvertently cumbersome. By simply reading the Active Record model's
code it is very hard to reason about everything that is happening around method
calls and callbacks. Similar to controller callbacks, these can also apply to
subsets of methods or be conditional to certain states, which further hinders
understanding the possible logic paths and makes code very hard to change and
maintain.</p>
<p>The very existence of callbacks in Active Record models is a smell in itself:
there is no reason not to replace them with explicit, direct method calls
through more thoughtful and meaningful software design.</p>
<h2>Lazy Loaded Active Record Associations</h2>
<p>Active Record is a robust and complex framework that abstracts in Ruby all the
interface with the relational database. A significant subset of the framework is
dedicated to abstract operations around foreign keys and references between
database tables, the Active Record Associations.</p>
<p>Using macros such as <code>has_many</code> and <code>belongs_to</code>, associations allow Active
Record models to define how they are linked to one another, dynamically defining
methods that return collections of associated records for a given Active Record
model instance. This is a classic behaviour in Rails apps that allow writing
features around nested resources very easily.</p>
<p>The problem with Active Record Associations is that these methods implement
lazy loading by default. The business logic might simply send a message to read
data from an already loaded method and inadvertently end up performing database
queries from the view layer. This is ultimately the source of performance issues
such as N+1 queries.</p>
<p>Giving Active Record models extra methods that reference and return instances of
other model classes is also a precedent in which much of customizations are
built upon, which makes it very hard to change code afterwards and fix slow
queries. Knowledge regarding assocations between models should, therefore, be
limited to optimization of database operations, such as in joins.</p>
<h2>Fat Active Record Models</h2>
<p>When looking for a suitable location to inject business logic, many developers
prefer to place this in Active Record classes. This is usually justified as a
more object-oriented approach, since controllers easily become too procedural as
seen in the previously listed smells.</p>
<p>Over time, Active Record models get overloaded with all sorts of
responsibilities, from validations that are unrelated to any of their
attributes, to sending emails, making network calls, and enqueueing jobs. These
are written as a multitude of class and instance methods, usually quite long
ones.</p>
<p>This excessive amount of methods and behaviour in Active Record models reach its
worst point in specific classes known as the god objects of the app: resources
that are so overloaded with behaviour that they have references to all other
main constants of the codebase, as well as being referenced by everybody else.</p>
<p>Active Record classes that are crowded with methods bear too many
responsibilities and are very hard to change. And the harder they are to change,
the less they are to be eligible for refactorings. These objects become then the
oldest and hardest technical debts to be paid.</p>
<h2>Private Methods in Active Record Models</h2>
<p>Similar to the problem of private methods in controllers, the creation of a
private interface in Active Record models is an antipattern to hide away the
fact that those classes are just too big and do too much. Like in controllers,
there should not be private methods in models except for reusability or if
referenced in macros when required by the framework.</p>
